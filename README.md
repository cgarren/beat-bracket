# Song Colosseum
## TODO
### High
- Add a way to add songs to queue
- Make the final bracket shareable with a link
- Make a toggle for songs exclusively by the artist vs songs the artist is featured on
- Better duplicate detection
- Improve seeding so that the top four songs are in the four corners
### Medium
- Make styling on searchbar for both keyboard and mouse option select consistent (currently purple outline for keyboard select and gray background for mouse hover)
- Allow user to delete certain songs
- Implement saving the bracket with every change linked to a users spotify account and stored in a db somewhere. Maybe a landing page where users can see their past brackets?
- Break into smaller components
- Get domain
- Display seed number/popularity in badge on each song button with toggle to hide it (maybe a badge for album/single/feature and toggles for each)
- Add metrics on generation like - number of songs, seconds it took to make, number from albums vs singles, etc...
- Make a toggle which decides which songs to include in the bracket in the first place (random vs popularity vs custom)
- Play from the beginning of songs (scrubber too maybe?)
- USE REFS INSTEAD OF REDRAWING EVERY TIME ONE THING CHANGES
- Make the bracket options more attractive/streamlined
### Low
- Make favicon
- Animation with one song knocking out or killing another song
- Option to include/exclude remixes (would have to be word detection or regex based, beta first)
- Make the bracket from a spotify playlist
- Full Mobile support (including songButton stretching toggle)
- Fix byes
- Use spotify metrics to filter (only kanye's slow songs, danceable songs, etc...)
- Make created playlist description fit on mobile
- Generate picture with just final four/eight for easy sharing. Maybe some pretty sharable grpahics that just show the winner and artist
- Once a column is finished zoom/scale the bracket to make it easier to do the next column
- Toggle to enable/disable songButton stretching to show the full
